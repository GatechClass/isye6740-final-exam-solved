Given m = 5 data points configuration in Figure 1. Assume K = 2 and use Manhattan distance (a.k.a. the `1 distance: given two 2-dimensional points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), their distance is |x1 − x2| + |y1 − y2|).

8 PCA for face recognition (20 points)

This question is a simplified illustration of using PCA for face recognition using a subset of data from the famous Yale Face dataset.

Remark: you have to perform downsampling of the image by a factor of 4 to turn them into a lower resolution image before we do anything.

1. (10 points) First, given a set of images for each person, we generate the so-called eigenface using these images. The procedure to obtain eigenface is explained as follows. Given n images of the same person denoted by x1,…,xn. Each image originally is a matrix. We vectorize each image to form the vector xi ∈ Rp. Now form a matrix

X = [x1,…,xn] ∈ Rp×n.

Extract the largest k eigenvector of the data matrix X&gt;X, denoted as u1,u2,…,uk. The eigenfaces correspond to the projections eigenfacei = Xui, i = 1,…,k.

Perform analysis on the Yale face dataset for subject 14 and subject 01, respectively, using all the images EXCEPT for the two images named subject01-test.gif and subject14-test.gif. Plot the top 6 eigenfaces for each subject. When visualizing, you have to reshape the eigenvectors into images with the same dimension as the original images.

What is the interpretation of the top 6 eigenfaces?

2. (10 points) Now we will perform a face recognition task.

For doing face recognition through PCA we proceed as follows. Given the test image subject01-test.gif and subject14-test.gif, we vectorize each image. Take the top eigenfaces of Subject 1 and Subject 14, respectively, project the 2 vectorized test images using the vectorized eigenfaces to obtain scores, respectively. (Hint: use (eigenface1)&gt;(test image) )

Report four scores: (1) projecting test image of Subject 1 using eigenface of Subject 1; (2) projecting test image of Subject 1 using eigenface of Subject 14; (3) projecting test image of Subject 14 using eigenface of Subject 1; (4) projecting test image of Subject 14 using eigenface of Subject 14.

Explain whether or not (and how) can you recognize the faces of the test images using these scores.

You are only required to finish ONE of the Programming Questions, i.e., please pick either Question 8 or Question 9 to work on. If you decide to try both, you will receive BONUS points (please indicate which question you would like to use as BONUS).

Please submit a zip folder, with your final answers (in pdf file format) and code for your Program Question(s).

9 Programming: Bayes and KNN classifier [20 points]

In this programming assignment, you are going to apply the Bayes Classifier to handwritten digits classification problem. Here, we use the binary 0/1 loss for binary classification, i.e., you will calculate the miss-classification rate as a performance metric. To ease your implementation, we selected two categories from USPS dataset in usps-2cls.mat (or usps-

2cls.dat, usps-2cls.csv).

1. (10 points) Your first task is implementing the classifier by assuming the covariance matrices for two classes are a diagonal matrix Σ1, Σ2.

Using slides from “Classification I”, assuming P(y = 1) = P(y = −1) (i.e., the prior distribution for two classes are the same), using Bayes decision rule to write down the decision boundary. (Hint, it should be a quadratic decision boundary.)

Now we will estimate the mean vector and the sample covariance matrices for two classes using the training data (hint: you can use sample mean and sample covariance vector). Report the misclassification rate (error rate) over the training set and over the testing set averaged over the 100 random train/test splits by using different value of splitting ratio p. Explain and compare the performance of each classifier.

After implementing these methods, you should evaluate your algorithm on the given set. Repeat 100 times: split the dataset into two parts randomly, use p portion for training and the other 1−p portion for testing. Let p change from 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8,

0.9.

Please implement the algorithm from scratch yourself. Make sure to provide code, results (required above) together with necessary explanations to your results.

2. (10 points) Now repeat the classification again using K-nearest neighbors, for K = 5,10,15,30. Repeat 100 times: split the dataset into two parts randomly, use p portion for training and the other 1 − p portion for testing. Let p change from 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 0.9. Report the training error and testing error for each case.
